- function for evaluation of expressions
   - implement case "x -> y -> (x -> y)"
   - implement re-normalization when negation absorbed (TODO set in the code)
   - implement "x & !x"-like rules for assosiative/commutative operations 
   - implement tests for multi-level evaluation (e.g. (!(x -> 0) -> (x -> 0) -> 0))
- function to open brackets
- function for DNF/SDNF/MinDNF building
- function for CNF/SCNF/MinCNF building
- function for Zhegalkin polinom building

- estimate props and cons of refusing the use of "call" qualifier and
  introduce support of returning value for functions.

------

For MinCNF/MinDNF: https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Метод_Куайна

------

Possible syntax for DNF/CNF group of functions:

   call scnf(f(x,y), 0110)

So we need to extract parse declaration functionality from the parser
and put it to some common place for re-usage.
