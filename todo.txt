- functions to operate with variables:
   - equal (must check equality of functions over the truth table)
- function for evaluation of expressions 
   - remains: finish implication and implement complex rules for other operations)
- function to open brackets
- function for DNF/SDNF/MinDNF building
- function for CNF/SCNF/MinCNF building
- function for Zhegalkin polinom building

For MinCNF/MinDNF: https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Метод_Куайна

Possible syntax for DNF/CNF group of functions:

   call scnf(f(x,y), 0110)

So we need to extract parse declaration functionality from the parser
and put it to some common place for re-usage.
