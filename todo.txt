- show position of erred character in the error message.
- function for evaluation of expressions.
   - fix of absense of normalization after making negation more representative:
        f(x, y, z) := (((x + y) -> 0) + z) -> 0
   - implement gluing rules.
- function to open brackets.
- function for DNF/SDNF/MinDNF building.
- function for CNF/SCNF/MinCNF building.
- function for Zhegalkin polinom building.

- estimate props and cons of refusing the use of "call" qualifier and
  introduce support of returning value for functions.

For MinCNF/MinDNF: https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Метод_Куайна

------

Possible syntax for DNF/CNF group of functions:

   call scnf(f(x,y), 0110)

So we need to extract parse declaration functionality from the parser
and put it to some common place for re-usage.
