- show position of erred character in the error message.
- enhance evaluation functionality:
   - Law of Blake-Porecky: (x | (!x & y)) => (x | y)
   - Consensus law: (x & y) | (!x & z) | (y & z) = (x & y) | (x & z)
- function to open brackets.
- function for DNF/SDNF/MinDNF building.
- function for CNF/SCNF/MinCNF building.
- function for Zhegalkin polinom building.

- estimate props and cons of refusing the use of "call" qualifier and
  introduce support of returning value for functions.

- "Variable name 'true' can't be reserved word." - Error in the error :)

- Pass all StrLenPtr by value or move to C++17 std::string_view.

- Enlarge tests of parsing.
  "Parameters are missing during usage of variable" isn't covered.

For MinCNF/MinDNF: https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Метод_Куайна

------

Possible syntax for DNF/CNF group of functions:

   call scnf(f(x,y), 0110)

So we need to extract parse declaration functionality from the parser
and put it to some common place for re-usage.
